# Clipboard Guardian

A VSCode extension that protects code integrity by blocking external clipboard operations while preserving normal copy/paste functionality within the editor.

## 🛡️ What it does

- **Blocks external pastes**: Prevents pasting content from browsers, AI tools, or other applications into VSCode
- **Prevents code leakage**: Stops copying VSCode content to external clipboard (optional)
- **Preserves internal operations**: Copy/paste between files and within VSCode works normally
- **Configurable protection**: Enable/disable features as needed

## 🎓 Educational Use Cases

**Perfect for academic environments** where code integrity matters:

- **Prevent AI assistance**: Blocks students from pasting code generated by ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot web, or other AI tools
- **Exam integrity**: Ensures coding assessments reflect genuine student knowledge
- **Assignment authenticity**: Prevents copy-pasting solutions from online sources
- **Learning reinforcement**: Encourages students to type code manually, improving retention
- **Academic honesty**: Supports institutional policies against unauthorized code assistance

## 💼 Additional Use Cases

- **Security-sensitive environments**: Prevent accidental code leaks
- **Corporate compliance**: Meet data loss prevention requirements  
- **Focus enhancement**: Avoid external distractions while coding
- **Code protection**: Keep proprietary code within the development environment


## 🚀 Installation
